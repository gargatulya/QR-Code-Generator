# QR-Code-Generator
A Javascript program that can generate QR code image of the user's input URL.
The program can be run on your VS code/ Atom terminal.
The node modules are already added but make sure your computer has node pre installed or install it.
The commands to run this are : node index.js
Then the terminal will ask for a URL link.
Once the user has provided the URL link the qr-image file will be updated with a new QR image and the user given link will also be added to the URL.txt file.
Now the user can scan the qr-image and use the link and if their is some issue with the link he can cross check his input in the URL.txt file.
